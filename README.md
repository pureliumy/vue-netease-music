This project is dependent on [NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi) project for getting offical data, so you need to run `NeteaseCloudMusicApi` locally first.

``` bash

git clone https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# server run at localhost:3000
npm start
```

# clone project
git clone https://github.com/pureliumy/vue-netease-music.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

## Summary of project
I came across many problems in this project, some of them have been resolved and some still exist, on the way to find and resolve problems I have learn a lot. For a better study of new knowledge and code experience, I am planning to write some summary referring to various aspects of this project after I finished the major function.
